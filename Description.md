## Introduction

Project MLH is designed to connect individuals within a specific range, aiding those working in the unorganized sector of 
our economy to find work more efficiently.
It serves as a platform for those in need of assistance, eliminating the hassle of finding helpers.
In an era dominated by online connections, Project MLH seeks to bridge the gap by facilitating offline connections.
Imagine scenarios like traveling in a city and needing a companion; this platform allows users to 
find helpers within their vicinity and decide whether they want to collaborate.

We use Django framework with Google maps to get the desired coordinates based on the user preference.

It addresses two major issues:
1. Loneliness
2. Work for people who want to aid their family & life.

I saw the issue closely, that people in unorganized sector of economy facing difficulty to find work, due to loopholes in the flow of information & heirarchical model.
And in the same way with modern lifestyle people are getting too busy, such that two people living under one-roof has different freetime with respect to their
work. Which leads to loneliness, With Project MLH they can find someone in their neighbour with whom they can spend time in offline/online, go for shopping together, 
play some game together, e.t.c.
